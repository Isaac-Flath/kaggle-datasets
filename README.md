# kaggle-datasets

I created functionality to automate and simplify the creation kaggle datasets containing pip libraries for offline installation.  To use this functionality directly check out [fastai's fastkaggle library](https://fastai.github.io/fastkaggle/) where I added the functionality to.

This repository is to automate the creation of these even further for users by automating this process and keeping popular libraries updated as datasets.  Rather than upload and maintain your own dataset library, [just use my kaggle datasets I maintain for common libraries](https://www.kaggle.com/isaacflath/datasets)!
